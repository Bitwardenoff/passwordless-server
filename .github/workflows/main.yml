# Note that as much as we'd love to avoid repetitive work, splitting the pipeline into separate jobs
# makes it very difficult to share artifacts between them. Even if we succeed, we'll still end up
# pushing and pulling gigabytes worth of data, which makes the jobs so much slower that we might as
# well just repeat the checkout-restore-build steps instead.

# Having a setup that involves separate jobs gives us significant benefits, on the other hand, namely:
# - Most of the jobs can run in parallel, which reduces the overall execution time significantly,
#   despite the repetitive work.
# - We can catch more issues this way, for example if the formatting job fails, we can still see the
#   the test results too.
# - If one of the jobs fails due to reasons unrelated to our code (e.g. NuGet server is down), we get
#   the option to rerun only that job, saving us time.
# - It's easier to understand what each job does (and later, read its output) because the scope is much
#   more narrow.
# - We can set permissions on a more granular (per-job) level, which allows us to expose only a few select
#   steps to more sensitive access scopes.
